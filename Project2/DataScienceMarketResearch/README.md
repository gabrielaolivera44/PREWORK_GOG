# Objective

Dicover a outlook of the Data Scientist roles and develop a web application for users to interact with and gather relevant data on Job Market in the U.S.



# Background

Data science and analytics (DSA) jobs are in high demand. According to Forbes, “[b]y 2020 the number of Data Science and Analytics job listings is projected to grow by nearly 364,000 listings to approximately 2,720,000.” They aren’t the easiest positions to fill, either. Forbes goes on to say that DSA jobs “remain open an average of 45 days, five days longer than the market average.”

Even people who have some basic knowledge of data science have confused the data scientist and data analyst roles. So, what’s the difference between a data scientist and a data analyst? Both work with data, but the key difference is what they do with this data.
